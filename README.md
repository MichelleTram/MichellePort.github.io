## 1. KPMG Virtual Internship: 
The KPMG AU Data Analytics Virtual Internship is designed to simulate a real-world data analytics project. Participants will work on a fictional client project, analyzing data and providing insights to drive business decisions. Task 1,2 will be entirely done by using Python (pandas, matplotlib and seaborn); task 3 will be done by using power BI. What I do in this project includes:
- Data Quality Assessment: Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis: [EDA](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y-izqnwTvoAtKY31lNRyshe-aP7AjGPB?usp=sharing)
- Data Insights: Targeting high-value customers based on customer demographics and attributes. [Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y-izqnwTvoAtKY31lNRyshe-aP7AjGPB?usp=sharing)
- Data Insights and Presentation: Using visualizations to present insights.

## 2. Telco customer churn analysis: 
The primary objective of this project is to extract valuable insights and devise actionable solutions to effectively tackle the issue of customer churn. The approach will involve the following key steps which will be completed by using Python (pandas, matplotlib and seaborn, profiling):
- Data understanding.
- Conducting an in-depth analysis to uncover the underlying drivers behind customer churn.
- Constructing a linear regression model to predict the churn score of customers for the upcoming quarter.
- Through this well-structured plan, the goal is to gain a deeper understanding of customer churn and implement strategies that will lead to improved customer retention and business success: [Churn analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xerbRib6_IGz4AiO6lqADpb4X3T9QCtb?usp=sharing) 

## 3. Pizza sales analysis
The primary objective of this project is to analyze key indicators for pizza sales data to gain insights into business performance. The approach will involve the following key steps:
