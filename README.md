1. KPMG Virtual Internship: The KPMG AU Data Analytics Virtual Internship is designed to simulate a real-world data analytics project. Participants will work on a fictional client project, analyzing data and providing insights to drive business decisions. What I do in this project includes:
- Data Quality Assessment: Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis: [EDA](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y-izqnwTvoAtKY31lNRyshe-aP7AjGPB?usp=sharing)
- Data Insights: Targeting high-value customers based on customer demographics and attributes. [Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y-izqnwTvoAtKY31lNRyshe-aP7AjGPB?usp=sharing)
- Data Insights and Presentation: Using visualizations to present insights.
## Task 1,2 will be entirely done by using Python (pandas, matplotlib and seaborn); task 3 will be done by using power BI.
